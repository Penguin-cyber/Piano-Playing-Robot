# June 8: Started designing the forearm

Today, I worked on drafting ideas for what the entire arm system might look like. This was done on a separate Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JBX58aGr_KxgK6paylfiLBcvCcq8-dvwz1_QLYsHlvY/edit?usp=sharing in the "Arm Decisions" Tab. The primary concern was on how the hand would access the keys in various ranges on the piano. Ultimately, I settled on doing a rail system, due to its simplicity. 

Otherwise, I began CADing the forearm in SolidWorks. I have general ideas for the servo motors and a concept in mind of what it may end up looking like. I am still figuring out where to place the ESP32 and the corresponding control boards for the serial communication. 

For packaging purposes, I may have to design a PCB that combines six serial ports in series, just so I donâ€™t have to use the boards that come with the servos, which are pretty space inefficient since they only combine two ports.
